    "##### Breakdown:\n",
    "1. Port Scanning (`-sS -sV`):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-sS`: Performs a SYN scan (fast and stealthy to detect open/closed ports).\n",
    "- `-sV`: Performs service version detection, which attempts to identify the service running on each open port.\n",
    "This scan checks all ports `(-p 1-65535)` on the specified target.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Parsing the Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `nm.all_hosts()`: Retrieves all the hosts that were scanned.\n",
    "- `nm[host]['tcp'][port]['state']`: Captures the state of each port (open/closed).\n",
    "- `nm``[host]['tcp'][port].get('name'`, 'unknown'): Attempts to capture the service name; if the service is not identified, it defaults to `'unknown'`.\n",
    "  `nm``[host]['tcp'][port].get('version'`, ''): Captures the version information (if available). This is important for more accurate detection of services.\n",
    "  \n",
    "1. Convert to DataFrame:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All parsed results are stored in a Pandas `DataFrame`, making it easier to work with and visualize the data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "4. Handling Service Names and Versions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Service`: Contains the service name (e.g., HTTP, SSH, etc.). If the service is unknown, it is labeled as `'unknown'`.\n",
    "- `Version`: Captures additional version info for the service (e.g., HTTP version, SSH version, etc.), which can be useful for vulnerability assessments.\n",
