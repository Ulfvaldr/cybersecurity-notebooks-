# Cybersecurity Jupyter Notebooks Showcase

Welcome to the **Cybersecurity Jupyter Notebooks Showcase**! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to demonstrate various cybersecurity tools and techniques, including network scanning, vulnerability analysis, and data visualization.

## Notebooks

### 1. Network Scanning with Nmap
- [Nmap Scan Analysis](nmap/nmap_scan_analysis.ipynb): A tutorial on how to perform a full network scan using Nmap and analyze the results.
- [Visualizing Nmap Scans](nmap/nmap_network_scan_visualization.ipynb): Learn how to visualize Nmap scan data using Python libraries like Pandas and Seaborn.

### 2. Vulnerability Analysis with Nmap and Vulners
- [Nmap + Vulners Vulnerability Scan](vulnerability-analysis/nmap_vulners_scan.ipynb): A guide to performing vulnerability analysis by combining Nmap with the Vulners API. Generate detailed vulnerability reports, including CVSS scores and severity levels.
- [Visualizing Vulnerabilities](vulnerability-analysis/nmap_vulners_visualization.ipynb): Visualize vulnerability data, including severity levels and the distribution of CVSS scores, using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
