# Cybersecurity Jupyter Notebooks Showcase

Welcome to the **Cybersecurity Jupyter Notebooks Showcase**! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to demonstrate various cybersecurity tools and techniques, including network scanning, vulnerability analysis, and data visualization.

## Notebooks

### 1. Network Scanning with Nmap
- [Nmap Scan Analysis](nmap/nmap_network_scan_visualization.ipynb): A tutorial on how to perform a full network scan using Nmap and analyze the raw results (e.g., open ports, services).

### 2. Visualizing Vulnerabilities
- [Visualizing Vulnerabilities](vulnerability-analysis/vulnerability_analysis_nmap_vulners.ipynb): Visualize vulnerability data, including severity levels and the distribution of CVSS scores, after scanning with Nmap and querying vulnerabilities with the Vulners API.

## Installation
